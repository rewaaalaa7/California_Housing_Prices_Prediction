## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 20640 instances and 10 attributes. The attributes are:

1. `longitude`: A floating-point number representing the longitude of the district.
2. `latitude`: A floating-point number representing the latitude of the district.
3. `housing_median_age`: A floating-point number representing the age of the house in the district.
4. `total_rooms`: An integer representing the total number of rooms in the district.
5. `total_bedrooms`: An integer representing the total number of bedrooms in the district.
6. `population`: An integer representing the population of the district.
7. `households`: An integer representing the total number of households in the district.
8. `median_income`: A floating-point number representing the median income of the households.
9. `median_house_value`: A floating-point number representing the median value of the house in the district.
10. `ocean_proximity`: A string representing how close the district is to the ocean.

## Installation

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using https://github.com/rewaaalaa7/California_Housing_Prices_Prediction.git
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
3. Open the `California_Housing_Prices_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter notebook.
4. Run each cell in the notebook to generate the predictions.

## Model Overview

The following machine learning models have been implemented to predict the median house value in Californian districts:

1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regression
3.Support Vector Regression

## Results

The performance of each model has been measured using the following evaluation metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- RÂ² Score

Based on the evaluation metrics, the Random Forest Regression model was the most successful at predicting median house value. However, as the repo's author notes in the conclusions section of the notebook, there is always room for improvement with further feature engineering, data cleaning, and hyperparameter tuning.
